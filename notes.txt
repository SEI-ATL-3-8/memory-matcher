What does the MVP of this game look like?
- grid of cards
- smallest possible: 4, enough to show the 2 possible outcomes of match / no-match
- each card has an image, but at first they all appear hidden
- all cards start with the same face-down image
- there are 2 copies of each image, therefore the total number of different images is half of the total number of cards
- they could have letters or numbers instead of images, then the backside of the cards could be designated with a ? or something
- there should only ever be 2 cards face-up in play at a time
- every first click starts a round, every second second click ends the round. after the round, we check the condition
- when you click on a card, IF it's the first one for the round, it stays up for the rest of the round
- when you click on a card, IF it's the second one for the round, you compare it to the first one
  - IF they match, leave em face up
  - IF they don't turn em face down
- when they're all face up, you win
- timer & moves counter could make you lose, BUT these don't have to be in mvp
- reset button should put them all face down (maybe randomize again?), BUT not mvp
- start button would be nice, but not mvp
- shuffling the images is post-mvp



Put the elements of this project into priority order, and draw a line separating the core goals from the stretch goals.

- make the grid
- display them face down
- when I click on a card it turns face up
- if they match they stay up
============
- shuffle the cards
- reset button







Fix the not-specific-enough user stories from the readme here:
When I load the page, I see 12 cards in a 3x4 grid face-down / blank




Convert your list of game goals into discrete user stories. User stories should roughly be in the form of: "When I <do x>, I see <y thing happening>"
